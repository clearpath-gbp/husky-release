  * Removed old bracket
  * Updated brackets
  * Change the reference heading of the GPS plugin to be east so the coordinate system is ENU
  * Rename DATUM_* to GAZEBO_WORLD_*. We're separating the datum from the world's origin, and this keeps envars from clobbering each other
  * LMS1XX Tower EnvVar (#250 <https://github.com/husky/husky/issues/250>)
    * Added second velodyne description
    * Added environment variable to remove the LMS1XX mount
    * Removed console output
  * Use DATUM_LAT and DATUM_LON envars to override the default reference lat/lon for the Gazebo GPS plugin. This addresses a compatibility issue with outdoor nav simulations

ros-noetic-husky-description (0.6.1-1focal) focal; urgency=high

  * Fixed error in URDF
  * Added Hokuyo
  * Check launch file only if testing
    When building husky_control, husky_description, husky_navigation or
    husky_viz without tests, CMake fails as it does not find
    catkin_run_tests_target command. This patch adds conditions to fix
    this problem.
  * Revert changes to mount_base_link to preserve use of origin argument; instead, simply created an additional plate link that sits between the supports and VLP16
  * Create visual geometry of vlp16_mount_base_link
  * Update mount support dimensions and spacing to better represent real-world measurements
  * [husky_description] Fixed malformed STL warning for top_plate.stl.

ros-noetic-husky-description (0.5.1-1focal) focal; urgency=high

  * cpr urdf extras
  * Remove the need to explicitly specify the laser_enabled, realsense_enabled, and urdf_extras arguments; use the envars to make it easier to simulate customized robots & use the moveit setup assistant.
  * Update intel_realsense.urdf.xacro
    modify image format in sim to avoid log warn spam
  * Add HUSKY_{FRONT|REAR}_BUMPER envars we can use to completely turn off the front & rear bumpers.  This is requested to make integration of the wireless charging docks easier
  * Add VLP16, secondary LMS1xx support (#164 <https://github.com/husky/husky/issues/164>)
    * Minimal refactor to add VLP16 + secondary LMS1xx support. Update defaults for the laser_enabled and realsense_enabled args to refer to the underlying envars to improve consistency when launching simulations. Modify the sensor bar to allow it to be positioned in the center by default, but with configurable xyz and rpy offsets
    * Add the new run dependencies
    * Remove the prefix's trailing underscore in the vlp16 mount to make it consistent. Fix an inconsistent envar for the sensor arch, add an arg to explicitly enable it, to stay internally consistent with the rest of Husky.
    * Fix the envars; its just HUSKY_LMS1XX, not HUSKY_LASER_LMS1XX
    * Revert to enabling the main laser by default in the simulations, add the velodyne_gazebo_plugins dependency
  * Add the ability to add the sensor bar with an envar without adding the realsense.  Add the sensor bar height as another arg + envar, fix the URDF when the 300mm sensorbar is enabled.

  * Remove support for the Kinect for Xbox 360. We've had the deprecation warning around for a while, so let's finally do it.  Realsense support is in-place as a drop-in replacement that gets added to the top rollbar, just like the old Kinect would have.
  * Changed intertial to inertial
    fixed a minor typo
  * Removed Paul Bovbel as maintainer.
  * Fix the warnings the ROS buildfarm was giving for Melodic
  * Add support for some environment variables to override realsense defaults
  * Use the STL from realsense2_description, rotated as necessary. Add realsense2_description to the dependencies
  * Refactor so that the sensor bar only gets added once if either the realsense OR the kinect is enabled. Adding both will still cause issues because they'll mount to the same point on the bracket, but at least the URDF won't fail.
  * Finish adding the simulated realsense to the topbar, add support for the physical realsense. Tidy up some parameters that were copied in last night but not yet configured.
  * Mark the Kinect for Xbox 360 as deprecated, start adding support for the Intel Realsense D400 series as a replacement
