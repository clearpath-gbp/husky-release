ros-melodic-husky-description (0.4.7-1bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * Add HUSKY_{FRONT|REAR}_BUMPER envars we can use to completely turn off the front & rear bumpers.  This is requested to make integration of the wireless charging docks easier

ros-melodic-husky-description (0.4.6-1bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * Add VLP16, secondary LMS1xx support (#164 <https://github.com/husky/husky/issues/164>)
    * Minimal refactor to add VLP16 + secondary LMS1xx support. Update defaults for the laser_enabled and realsense_enabled args to refer to the underlying envars to improve consistency when launching simulations. Modify the sensor bar to allow it to be positioned in the center by default, but with configurable xyz and rpy offsets
    * Add the new run dependencies
    * Remove the prefix's trailing underscore in the vlp16 mount to make it consistent. Fix an inconsistent envar for the sensor arch, add an arg to explicitly enable it, to stay internally consistent with the rest of Husky.
    * Fix the envars; its just HUSKY_LMS1XX, not HUSKY_LASER_LMS1XX
    * Revert to enabling the main laser by default in the simulations, add the velodyne_gazebo_plugins dependency
  * Add the ability to add the sensor bar with an envar without adding the realsense.  Add the sensor bar height as another arg + envar, fix the URDF when the 300mm sensorbar is enabled.

ros-melodic-husky-description (0.4.4-1bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * Remove support for the Kinect for Xbox 360. We've had the deprecation warning around for a while, so let's finally do it.  Realsense support is in-place as a drop-in replacement that gets added to the top rollbar, just like the old Kinect would have.
  * Changed intertial to inertial
    fixed a minor typo
  * Removed Paul Bovbel as maintainer.
  * Fix the warnings the ROS buildfarm was giving for Melodic
  * Add support for some environment variables to override realsense defaults
  * Use the STL from realsense2_description, rotated as necessary. Add realsense2_description to the dependencies
  * Refactor so that the sensor bar only gets added once if either the realsense OR the kinect is enabled. Adding both will still cause issues because they'll mount to the same point on the bracket, but at least the URDF won't fail.
  * Finish adding the simulated realsense to the topbar, add support for the physical realsense. Tidy up some parameters that were copied in last night but not yet configured.
  * Mark the Kinect for Xbox 360 as deprecated, start adding support for the Intel Realsense D400 series as a replacement
